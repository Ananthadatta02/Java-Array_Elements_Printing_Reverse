# Java-Array_Elements_Printing_Reverse
This Java program takes an array input from the user, prints the elements, and then displays them in reverse order. The program allows users to specify the size and elements of the array, making it interactive. It demonstrates basic array handling and manipulation in Java, including using loops and the Arrays.toString() method for display.
